title: Things are moving fast. What should I learn?

As a new developer, I often find myself asking this question a lot. In the beginning, the answer was simple, learn React. But as I dive deeper into the ocean of software development (mostly web tbh) I see more and more things get added to my "I'll learn this later" list. Then I got introduced into the world of blockchain and smart contacts, and now I need to learn solidity too? This list makes me anxious. Am I learning the right thing? I browse through forums, article, youtube videos, and as a result it makes me more confused.

But I take advice from people I admire from developer communities. I will name them, as I believe they genuinely create a positive impact, at least for me it did. Kunal Kushwaha, Theo Brown, Kevin Powell, Jonathan Ma, those are my virtual mentors. A good rule of thumb is, as a beginner, return to the fundamentals. In web, that means git gud at vanilla CSS and JS.

And so that was my approach for a while. While I believe it is a good rule of thumb, there was always an itch, to create stuff I find cool. In fact that was the reason I got into this in the first place, to build cool stuff.

I stumble across an interesting take regarding this issue that plagues me. And that is to look into the "Why" I wanna learn. Is it to get that sweet sweet high paying job? Yeah, probably. But is that the best way to make money? Probably not. Then why do I choose software development?

Cause I like building stuff, I like figuring out stuff to make things work. So why am I learning what I'm learning? I believe because, I want to, genuinely, be a good engineer.

I have spent too much time, not doing things I should be doing, to be where I want to be. And that reflects the unhappiness in my life. Inaction. This brings my to the crux of this post. You should learn what you need to learn, to build the things you want to build.

Am I good at vanilla JS, CSS, React, REST api, other fundamentals? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Then why am I fiddling with Next.js, tailwind, tprc and other "advanced frameworks" that you should only learn when you are "good enough"? Because there are things I want to built, and these are tools I want to use.

Is this the best approach to be a developer, to get that high paying job? Probably no. In fact, nope it's not. But it does help me to be a better engineer. And it helps to motivate me. It keeps me going. Going through exercise, reading books, doing courses, is boring. I don't have the discipline so I will rely on motivation, and hopefully it will pay off.

I have learn so much by just building, many of those through failing, and looking for solutions. And the knowledge sticks way better. Things don't work as expected most of the time, finding out the why, implementing it, and looking at better developers approach to the problem, has taught me a lot.

And that is my two cent on this conundrum. Of course, it's my opinion, and I might be wrong. Everyone has their own approach to learning.
